# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description

This password generator takes user inputs from javascript prompts to create a random password. The criteria that the user chooses for this password include the length of the password which is between 8 and 128 characters, whether or not the password contains lowercase characters, uppercase characters, numerical characters, and special characters. The user will click a button labeled "Generate Password" that will begin the prompts. Once the criteria have been set by the prompts, the randomly generated password meeting the criteria will appear in a textbox.
